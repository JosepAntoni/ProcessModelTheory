* Predictive vs Adaptive Models 
* Software Development 
* Project Planning

****
In previous sessions, we talked about the companies, projects and resulting products. We talked 
about how the porject is initiated in a company. During this session, we will talk about project 
planning. One important aspect of the project planning is the selection of the software development
model and the corresponding implementation of the plan in for of GANTT chart.

==  Predictive vs Adaptive Models 

[.cue]
****
All software development models are categorised in Predictive and Adaptative models. These models represent
a way of thinking and solving a problem. As allways, there is not better group of models than others.
****

== Predictive Models

[.cue]
****
The first group of models refers to the predictve way of thinking. Predictive models are *Linear* Models
in which the project is constantly developed until the end. Predictive models/projects are divided in 
different *phases or stages* and the project ends once executed all the phases. Commonly, the structure of 
this kind of projects begins with a *requirements phase* and adter requirements the projects is being developed
and tested.

== Adaptive Models

****
As contrary, adaptive models refers to models that iteratively or incremently improves the product 
along the lifecycle until achieve the final product. The main feature of this models are the capacity 
to *adapt* to existing situations. Commonly, this models are divided in iterations and sprints. In each
iteration or sprint, a new *functional prototype* is being developed and validated by the clients. Thus,
it is commonly that the requirements changes along the project lifecycle (iterations).

The coming slides will show an example between predictive and adaptive travelers. In this example, we 
have to plan a travel from Barcelona-London with a budget of 600€ for 3 days. How will proceed each 
of the travelers?

****
The predictive traveler divides the travel in different steps starting from the Barcelona flights, the
hotels in London, the monuments to visit and finally, the come back home. Everything is planned and 
scheduled linearly in time until the end of the travel. What happen if something unexpected occurs?

== Unexpected Situation

[.cue]
****
If some unexpected situation occurs, then, the predictive traveler has to re-schedle the whole plan. It 
could impact in some unexpected costs and delays at the end of the travel.

== Adaptive Traveler Planning

[.cue]
****
The adaptive traveler only plans the first or two first days of the travel. Then the rest of the days 
are planned based on the interests of the traveler or the weather. What happen if something unexpected 
occurs?

****
In that case, the asociated costs are minimised to the planned window and makes open the rest of the 
days to plan anything.

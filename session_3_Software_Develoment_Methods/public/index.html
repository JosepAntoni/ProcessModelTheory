<aside role="note"><p>In previous sessions, we talked about the companies, projects and resulting products. We talked
about how the porject is initiated in a company. During this session, we will talk about project
planning. One important aspect of the project planning is the selection of the software development
model and the corresponding implementation of the plan in for of GANTT chart.</p></aside></section>
<section class="slide-agenda-title"><h2>Predictive vs Adaptive Models</h2><aside role="note"><p>All software development models are categorised in Predictive and Adaptative models. These models represent
a way of thinking and solving a problem. As allways, there is not better group of models than others.</p></aside></section>
<section class="slide-title-down image" style="background-image: url(images/predictive.jpg); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat"><h2>Predictive Models</h2>
<aside role="note"><p>The first group of models refers to the predictve way of thinking. Predictive models are <strong>Linear</strong> Models
in which the project is constantly developed until the end. Predictive models/projects are divided in
different <strong>phases or stages</strong> and the project ends once executed all the phases. Commonly, the structure of
this kind of projects begins with a <strong>requirements phase</strong> and adter requirements the projects is being developed
and tested.</p></aside></section>
<section class="slide-title-down image" style="background-image: url(images/adaptive.jpg); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat"><h2>Adaptive Models</h2>
<aside role="note"><p>As contrary, adaptive models refers to models that iteratively or incremently improves the product
along the lifecycle until achieve the final product. The main feature of this models are the capacity
to <strong>adapt</strong> to existing situations. Commonly, this models are divided in iterations and sprints. In each
iteration or sprint, a new <strong>functional prototype</strong> is being developed and validated by the clients. Thus,
it is commonly that the requirements changes along the project lifecycle (iterations).</p></aside></section>
<section class="slide-title-top image" style="background-image: url(images/summary-models.jpeg); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat"><h2>Predictive vs Adaptive Models (Summary)</h2></section>
<section class="topic image" style="background-image: url(images/pred-adapt-title.jpeg); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat">
<aside role="note"><p>The coming slides will show an example between predictive and adaptive travelers. In this example, we
have to plan a travel from Barcelona-London with a budget of 600€ for 3 days. How will proceed each
of the travelers?</p></aside></section>
<section class="slide-title-down image" style="background-image: url(images/adaptive-traveller.jpg); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat"><h2>Predictive Traveller</h2></section>
<section class="slide-title-top image" style="background-image: url(images/pred-costs.jpeg); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat"><h2>Predictive Traveler Planning</h2>
<aside role="note"><p>The predictive traveler divides the travel in different steps starting from the Barcelona flights, the
hotels in London, the monuments to visit and finally, the come back home. Everything is planned and
scheduled linearly in time until the end of the travel. What happen if something unexpected occurs?</p></aside></section>
<section class="slide-title-down image" style="background-image: url(images/delay.jpg); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat"><h2>Unexpected Situation</h2>
<aside role="note"><p>If some unexpected situation occurs, then, the predictive traveler has to re-schedle the whole plan. It
could impact in some unexpected costs and delays at the end of the travel.</p></aside></section>
<section class="slide-title-down image" style="background-image: url(images/predictive-traveller.jpg); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat"><h2>Adaptive Traveller</h2></section>
<section class="slide-title-top image" style="background-image: url(images/adapt-costs.jpeg); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat"><h2>Adaptive Traveler Planning</h2>
<aside role="note"><p>The adaptive traveler only plans the first or two first days of the travel. Then the rest of the days
are planned based on the interests of the traveler or the weather. What happen if something unexpected
occurs?</p></aside></section>
<section class="slide-title-down image" style="background-image: url(images/delay.jpg); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat"><h2>Unexpected Situation</h2>
<aside role="note"><p>In that case, the asociated costs are minimised to the planned window and makes open the rest of the
days to plan anything.</p></aside></section>
<section class="slide-agenda-title"><h2>Software Development Models</h2></section>
<section class="slide-title-down image" style="background-image: url(images/waterfall-2.jpeg); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat"><h2>Waterfall Model</h2>
<aside role="note"><p>The waterfall model is a sequencial model in which th stages are executed linearly in time. That means,
one task do not start until the precedent task ends. Once the task is executed and finished, the task do
not execute again.</p></aside></section>
<section class="slide-title-top image" style="background-image: url(images/waterfall-sum.jpeg); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat"><h2>Waterfall Features</h2>
<aside role="note"><p>Regarding the waterfall model, all the efforts are performed at the begining with exhaustive task
in the requirements gathering. Moreover, this model contains high documentation and strict planning.
These both aspects are considered as an advantage.</p>
<p>As a disadvantage, this model is quite irreal in terms of strictly execute the tasks. Commonly, it
is quite irreal to have all requirements at the beginng. Moreover, it is quite irreal that there is
not any change in the project tasks. Finally, this model has the disadvantage of testing the product
at the end of the process, putting the response time to error in risks. Moreover, there is not user
feedback until the product is delivered (too much risk!!)</p></aside></section>
<section class="slide-title-down image" style="background-image: url(images/iterative.png); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat"><h2>Iterative Model</h2>
<aside role="note"><p>The iterative model is formed by multiple iterations. Each iteration comprise all the development
phases (requirements, analysis, design, coding and testing). This method permits to redefine and
adjust the work performed along the project lifecycle (at the beginign more efforts in requirements
and at the end of the project, more efforts in the testing.)</p></aside></section>

<section class="slide-title-down image" style="background-image: url(images/agile.jpg); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat"><h2>Agile Model</h2>
<aside role="note"><p>Agile models starts with the asumption that the changes are unaviodable. Agile methods are adaptable
to changes in form of small iterations in which the end-users are continoulsy involved. Thus, the product
is evolved considering end-users feedback until the product is finalised and validated by the clients.</p></aside></section>
<section class="slide-title-top image" style="background-image: url(images/agile-sum.jpeg); background-size: cover; background-repeat: no-repeat"><h2>Agile Features</h2>
<aside role="note"><p>In detail, Agile models are ideal for small work teams due to their informal management. Despite this,
agile has been implemented in enterprises with high sucessful ratios. Moreover, agile is totally adaptable
to changes and customers feedback due to the division of the product development in different and
short-time sprints. In each sprint, we create a <strong>functional prototypes</strong> that passess the corresponding
test. This <strong>functional prototypes</strong> accomplish several products functionalities that at the end of the
sprint are validated by the client. So, the customer involvement is a huge benefit for creating a
product.</p>
<p>The constant implication of the clients could be a constraint in terms of defining the final scope of
the product (the clients always wants more). This limitation in the scope also is aligned with a
limitation in the budget (the clients wannt lot of functionalities at lower prices). Finally, when
implementing agile models, we need to take care of teh documentation. In agile there is not so
much documentation but we need to elaborate strictly needed documentation for product understanding
(specifications).</p></aside></section>

timeframed into a temporal scale (weeks, months, years). As contrary, operative work is a repetitive

(software, report, etc). However, the operative work as name indicates is based on repetitive results
(same result over time).</p>

refers to a newer product. As contrary, operative work refers to maintenance tasks, audits, etc.</p></aside></section>

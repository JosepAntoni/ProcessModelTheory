"A project is a temporal effort that is carried out with the aim of creating a product, 
 service or result unique."
-- PMBook

[.cue]
****
One of the most accurated definition of a project is the one provided by the PMBook: 
"A project is a temporal effort that is carried out with the aim of creating a product, 
 service or result unique."
****

[.slide-title-down]
== Temporal
image::begin-end.jpg[Temporal Feature,1280,720,role=cover canvas]

[.cue]
****
One important feature of a project is the temporal feature. Every project has defined a begin and end. 
****

[.slide-title-top]
== Temporal Feature
image::temporal-features.jpeg[Temporal Features,1280,720,role=cover canvas]

[.cue]
****
Subsequently to the definition of the begin and end, a project also have a limitation in resources and
there isn't a repetition of the project. 
****

[.slide-title-down]
== Unique
image::unique.jpg[Unique,1280,720,role=cover canvas]

[.cue]
****
Complementing the temporal feature, a project is an unique. That means, there are no identical projects. 
It could be tangible or intangible with different deliveries. 
****

[.slide-title-top]
== Unique Feature

In reference to the unique feature, each project could be a part of a product, service, improvements
or results.

== Project vs Operative Work
image::project-operative-work.jpg[Be or not not be,1280,720,role=cover canvas]

[.cue]
****
At this moment, one important aspect is the differentiation between projects and operative work. 
****

[.slide-title-top]
== Project vs Operative Work
image::diff-project-operative-work.jpeg[Diff Operatve Work,1280,720,role=cover canvas]

[.cue]
****
The main difference between projects and operative works refers to the duration. The projects are 
timeframed into a temporal scale (weeks, months, years). As contrary, operative work is a repetitive 
work during time. 

Another difference is in the type of outcome. In the projects there is a unique result 
(software, report, etc). However, the operative work as name indicates is based on repetitive results 
(same result over time). 

The third main difference is the type of outcome. In case of the projects, the type of outcome commonly
refers to a newer product. As contrary, operative work refers to maintenance tasks, audits, etc.

== Project vs Operative Work (Exercise)

[.slide-title-down]
== Exercise

****
**Exercise**. The Ipad product is a project or an operative work? 
****

[.slide-title-down]
== Depends
image::ipad-exercise.jpeg[Exercise Operative Work Solution,1280,720,role=cover canvas]

[.cue]
****
It depends to which process we focus on. If we think on the Ipad conception, it is a project. However,
if we think in the Ipad production, it is an operative work.

[.slide-agenda-title]
== Project vs Product Lifecycle

[.slide-title-top]
== Project Lifecycle
image::project-lifecycle.png[Project Lifecycle,1280,720,role=cover canvas]

[.cue]
****
Inside the companies, we usually have projects and products. Projects and products have different 
lifecycles. Project lifecycle is the process to generate this newer produtct. The project lifecycle 
starts with a project idea (initial idea/customer need to make a response). Based on this idea, the
project is planned along the time and with their corresponding efforts. The plan is the general guide 
for the execution, in which the newer product is materialised. During the execution we need constantly
to monitor and control the project to finalise it in the required time, with the established efforts 
and also with the expected quality. Once the project is finalised, the closing stage focuses on 
launching the newer product to the market or give them to the corresponding customer. 

Once the project lifecycle ends, it startsit starts the product lifecycle. 
****

[.slide-title-top]
== Product Lifecycle
image::product-lifecycle.jpeg[Product Lifecycle,1280,720,role=cover canvas]

[.cue]
****
The product lifecycle directly depends on the sales. It begins with the introduction aimed at market
outreach. Then, the product is going to gain market share and give benefits to the company (growth). 
The sales growth arrives when the product is established in the market (sales establishment). when
this happens, the product is on the maturity. Finally the products starts to lose market due to other 
products gains your marketshare. This stage is called "decline". When the product starts to decline 
it needs a renewal to maintain it in the market. If not, the product will die. 

Nowadays, this product lifecicle is terrible short (1-2 years) and it needs that companies has to be 
very flexible to be competitive and do not die as well. To avoid this the companies has to elaborate 
a great variety of products to be present in different markets and maintain their own lifecycle.

== Project vs Product Lifecycle Summary
image::project-product.jpeg[Diff Project and Product,1280,720,role=cover canvas]

[.cue]
****
To sum up, the main difference between projects and products lifecycles are: 
- Product Lifecycle is longer (in time) than Project Lifecycle.
- Prduct Lifecycle starts when Project ends.
- Product Lifecycle could include multiple Project Lifecycle.

During this session, we talked about the companies, the projects and the products. However, we 
didn't mention how the projects are created. Mainly, the projects are created by considering the 
following circumstances: 
- Bussiness Need. This refers to the market need for an specific solution or product. 
- Technologic Advancement. The project is driven by the introduction of newer technology inside the market.
- Client Need. Our customers needs some specific solution.  
- Legal Requirement. Governance or Laws changes and newer products could be derived from them.

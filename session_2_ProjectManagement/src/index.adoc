"A project is a temporal effort that is carried out with the aim of creating a product, 
 service or result unique."
-- PMBook

[.cue]
****
One of the most accurated definition of a project is the one provided by the PMBook: 
"A project is a temporal effort that is carried out with the aim of creating a product, 
 service or result unique."
****

[.slide-title-down]
== Temporal
image::begin-end.jpg[Temporal Feature,1280,720,role=cover canvas]

[.cue]
****
One important feature of a project is the temporal feature. Every project has defined a begin and end. 
****

== Temporal Feature
image::temporal-features.jpeg[Temporal Features,1280,720,role=cover canvas]

[.cue]
****
Subsequently to the definition of the begin and end, a project also have a limitation in resources and
there isn't a repetition of the project. 
****

[.slide-title-down]
== Unique

Complementing the temporal feature, a project is an unique. That means, there are no identical projects. 
It could be tangible or intangible with different deliveries.

== Project vs Operative Work

[.cue]
****
At this moment, one important aspect is the differentiation between projects and operative work. 
****

[.slide-title-top]
== Project vs Operative Work
image::diff-project-operative-work.jpeg[Diff Operatve Work,1280,720,role=cover canvas]

[.cue]
****
The main difference between projects and operative works refers to the duration. The projects are 
timeframed into a temporal scale (weeks, months, years). As contrary, operative work is a repetitive 
work during time. 

Another difference is in the type of outcome. In the projects there is a unique result 
(software, report, etc). However, the operative work as name indicates is based on repetitive results 
(same result over time). 

The third main difference is the type of outcome. In case of the projects, the type of outcome commonly
refers to a newer product. As contrary, operative work refers to maintenance tasks, audits, etc.

== Exercise

**Exercise**. The Ipad product is a project or an operative work? 
****

[.slide-title-down]
== Depends
image::ipad-exercise.jpeg[Exercise Operative Work Solution,1280,720,role=cover canvas]

[.cue]
****
It depends to which process we focus on. If we think on the Ipad conception, it is a project. However,
if we think in the Ipad production, it is an operative work.
